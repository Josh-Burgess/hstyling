            Hi! Hola! Bonjour! My name is Yolandie and I have been styling for what feels like my whole life!
            As much as we all want others to get to know us and who we are as people, judgments based on our appearance
            are a fact of reality.

            I learned this very young and developed it into a love of all things fashion and a need for constant
            improvement. This began with a Bachelors degree in Fashion Marketing and has been supplemented by 15 years
            in retail working with customers and creating inspiring displays. You know that imeppecably dressed
            mannequin you walk by in a store and think to yourself, I wish I could dress that well, that was me! In
            addition to all the people I’ve dressed as part of my career in retail, I have also worked on live theatre
            productions costuming the actors. Lastly, very early in my career I had a brief stint as a dance costume
            designer.

            What does all this experience mean for you? It translates into an extensive expertise in fabric knowledge
            and fit as well as how that all works on your body and projects the image you desire. Whether that image is
            professional and powerful for a big meeting or sophisticated and elegant on your wedding day, I am in
            business to empower you though style!

            As Marc Jacobs once said, “clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them.”
            What do you want your style to say you're living for?
